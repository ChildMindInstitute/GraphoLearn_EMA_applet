Some of the applets will involve daily questions, some weekly questions and some questions will only be asked once. It’s important that you fill these out to the best of your ability each day/week so we can track your child’s interactions with the intervention games and other aspects of their schooling, environment and general health. Each applet should take five minutes or less to complete",
